# Advanced-Java-D387 
This project enhances a Spring and Angular-based hotel reservation system to support internationalization and cloud deployment. Designed to meet new requirements for global use, the application offers multithreaded language support, time zone conversion for scheduling, and displays pricing in multiple currencies.

# Key Features
Multithreaded Localization: Resource bundles display welcome messages in both English and French to comply with Canadian requirements.

Currency Display: Prices for reservations are shown in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, and euros.

Time Zone Conversion: A method converts times between ET, MT, and UTC for scheduling live presentations.

# Docker and Cloud Deployment
Docker Integration: The application is containerized with a Dockerfile that includes all required code for the multithreaded 
Spring application, making it easy to run in isolated environments.

Cloud Deployment: Guidance for deploying the containerized application on cloud platforms, enabling scalability and accessibility for global users.
